 Project - MVP
 1. Create a script that allows user input and assigns the values to some variables
 2. Uses requests library to pass these as parameters to the Spotify API
 3. Handle responses using the json library
 




Project - Other ideas
 1. Web app using Flask
 2. Accept user input parameters and save them either in a d/b or dataframe
 3. Using requests to make calls to the Spotify API using those parms
 4. Handle the responses and maybe put these into a dataframe
 5. Use seaborn to present this in a graph
 6. Use selenium to inout some stuff into 

 requests and beautiful soup
 use sets
 use the json library to handle the json responses
